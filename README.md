# AirBnB-Amsterdam-Investment-Project
Analyzed AirBnB data to develop real estate investment plans in Amsterdam

DataSet contains: host_id, Number of listings, host_name, host_since_year, host_since_anniversary, Date Joined, Member Since, id, neighbourhood, city, state, zipcode, country, latitude, longitude, property_type, room_type, accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, beds, bed_type, price, guests_included, extra_people, minimum_nights, Revenue, Total Revenue, Revenue, X total no. of stays, host_response_time, host_response_rate, number_of_reviews, review_scores_rating, review_scores_accuracy, review_scores_cleanliness,	review_scores_checkin, review_scores_communication,	review_scores_location, review_scores_value

I used the above information of 6210 users and created a presentation for potential real estate investors in the Amsterdam area. 

After working on the dataset, I realize how important it is to clean, organize and understand the data. It takes more time to clean and restructure than analyzing it. I learnt about the business model to develop a better idea as to the client needs. After cleaning the data, the analysis part was very interesting as I had to switch different rows and columns to understand the correlation between each. The visualization part helped me understand the relationship as bar graphs and pie charts give a clear picture of the data.
